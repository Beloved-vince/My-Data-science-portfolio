    "# Overview\n",
    "Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose. Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\r",
    "According to **WHO** \r\n",
    "In 2014, 8.5% of adults aged 18 years and older had diabetes. In 2019, diabetes was the direct cause of 1.5 million deaths and 48% of all deaths due to diabetes occurred before the age of 70 years. Another 460 000 kidney disease deaths were caused by diabetes, and raised blood glucose causes around 20% of cardiovascular deaths (1).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Between 2000 and 2019, there was a 3% increase in age-standardized mortality rates from diabetes. In lower-middle-income countries, the mortality rate due to diabetes increased 13%.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "By contrast, the probability of dying from any one of the four main noncommunicable diseases (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases or diabetes) between the ages of 30 and 70 decreased by 22% globally between 2000 andopulation. 2019."

    "### There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes.\n",
    "- Type 1 diabetes (previously known as insulin-dependent, juvenile or childhood-onset) is characterized by deficient insulin production and requires daily administration of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps your body use glucose for energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes. It occurs when your body doesn't respond normally to insulin, or when your body doesn't produce enough insulin.\n",

    "- Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. It usually goes away after the baby is born.\n",

    "## The Mission\n",
    "In this notebook I will be analyzing the most important factors in determining a person's diabetes diagnosis, and using those diagnosis to classify a dataset of patients. I will be using user Jullien Nazreen’s dataset titled \"Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset\" - specifically, .csv file titled \"diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2021.csv\".\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This dataset contains a binary diabetes response variable, with either 0 representing no diabetes or 1 representing some form of diabetes (either Type 1 or Type 2), for each patient, along with 21 explanatory variables ranging along a multitude of lifestyle and socioeconomic factors."
